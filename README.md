# Rope Rescue Calculator

A field-oriented calculator designed for rope rescue setup and training.

This tool helps instructors, assistants, and trainees quickly estimate:
- Rope tension caused by angles (V-angle / track line)
- Load distribution on anchors
- Tension multiplier effects
- Basic risk awareness during system setup

## Current Module
- Symmetrical V-angle rope tension calculator
  - Input total load and angle
  - Output tension per rope leg and anchor
  - Includes visual risk warnings based on angle sensitivity

## Design Principles
- Minimal input, immediate feedback
- Field-first, not theory-first
- Supports teaching, discussion, and quick decision-making
- Assumptions are clearly stated for training transparency

## Notes
- All calculations assume symmetrical systems unless stated otherwise.
- This calculator is for estimation and training purposes, not a substitute for professional judgment.

## Roadmap (Planned)
- Mechanical advantage & hauling force estimation
- Friction and redirection loss modeling
- Asymmetrical system support
- Exportable text/image summaries for teaching use
